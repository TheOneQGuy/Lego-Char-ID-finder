# Lego-Char-ID-finder
This is a tool to get character names for the MINIFIGCUSTOMISERPARTS_AUTOGENERATED.XML file and its variants (e.g. MINIDOLLCUSTOMISERPARTS_AUTOGENERATED.XML in TLM2). This file uses weird numbers (e.g. -2138279224 for Iron Man Mark 6) to referance characters instead of the normal CD names (e.g. IRONMANMARK6) and was included in all Tt Games' LEGO games startomg from LEGO Marvel Avengers.

This files controls the customizer in these games, and for some games like LEGO Worlds and The LEGO Movie Videogame 2, modifying it is necessary for being able to play as the character.

For the longest time it wasn't known how to get the number for a character that wasn't already included, and since it's Generated automatically, no unused characters are included there.

Buuuuuut I was somehow able to convince ChatGPT to make a site that got the number for a character just by giving it the CD name after like 50 times of me spotting a problem and telling ChatGPT to fix it, only to make a new problem (*It was harder than it sounds like...*) So anyways enjoy!

P.S. I would share my conversation with ChatGPT, but I uploaded an image in that conversation so I can't for some reason. Also I have no idea how the tool actually works and I don't know HTML, it was created entirely by ChatGPT (The "Reason" feature helped so much because otherwise it just made things up) and me just changing some UI text.
